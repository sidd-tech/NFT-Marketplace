NFT Marketplace
-------------------------

It is an Web 3.0 project where an user can come and mint, list their NFT. Another user can come and buy the NFT by paying the listed amount (with commission for website). This is inspired by the largest NFT market OpenSea.

So,
There are 2 smart contract on this project one is for the NFT and the other is for Marketplace (written in Solidity).
The NFTs minted and listed follows ERC-721 protocol and the entire project is deployed in local blockchain node created using HardHat. 
I have done the entire backend process of these project using Solidity ,JavaScript and Node.js while my one friend has helped in making the frontend with HTML and React.
